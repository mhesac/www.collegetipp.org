<h1>Tuition Installment Payment Plan</h1>
<h2>What is a tuition installment payment plan?</h2>
<p>A Tuition Installment Payment Plan - as offered to you
by your school and Higher Education Services, Inc. - allows
students and families to make monthly
payments to a school for tuition, and room and board.
Usually these installment payments are spread over 5
months per semester, beginning August 1 for Fall
semester and January 1 for Spring semester.
</p>
<h2>How does it help students and families?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of making a tuition payment for the full amount, plan participants can make smaller payments over a period of 5 months per semester.  </li>
<li>The opportunity to make smaller payments on a monthly basis makes the cost of higher education more manageable and minimizes the amount that families need to borrow in student loans.</li>
<li> Participation does not affect eligibility for financial aid.  </li>
<li>Payments are interest free; a small, one-time enrollment fee is required. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don't wait!</strong> Sign up for a tuition installment payment
plan today and start investing in your future!</p>
