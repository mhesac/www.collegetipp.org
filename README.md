# CollegeTIPP

## Purpose

Arlene works with Montana universities and TIPP and is responsible for this site. At this time, senior management wants to leave the TIPP program out there. This site might still be used by UGF and Western.

## Hosting and DNS

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/).

This domain is registered with GoDaddy and the DNS is managed there. The naked domain, `collegetipp.org`, is forwarded to `www.collegetipp.org`. A CNAME record for `www.collegetipp.org` points to `safmt.github.io`.

## History

This site was the first attempt at using external hosting for static websites for SAF. This site was originally hosted internally on JBoss. For more information see https://jira.amicus.local/browse/CCR-2810.
