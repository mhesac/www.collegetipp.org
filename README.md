# Purpose

Arlene works with Montana universities and TIPP and is responsible for this site. At this time, senior management wants to leave the TIPP program out there. This site might still be used by UGF and Western.

# Hosting

Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a [Project Page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages).

# DNS

Domain name is registered at GoDaddy and all DNS is there. According to [best practices](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/) the "www" version of the domain is the official version. A CNAME record for `www.collegetipp.org` points to `mhesac.github.io` and A records point to IP addresses at Github which handle redirection to `www.collegetipp.org`.

# History

This site was the first attempt at using external hosting for static websites for SAF. This site was originally hosted internally on JBoss. For more information see https://jira.amicus.local/browse/CCR-2810.
