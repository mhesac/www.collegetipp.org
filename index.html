<div id="content">
<p><strong>Tuition installment payment plans are making college more affordable for students throughout Montana.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do tuition installment payment plans help students and families?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of making two or three lump sum payments, plan participants can make timely, smaller payments for the academic year over a period of 10 months.</li>
<li>The opportunity to make smaller payments on a monthly basis allows many students and families to minimize the amount they need to borrow in student loans, including PLUS loans.</li>
<li>Payments are interest free.</li>
</ul>
